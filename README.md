BreakOut in Python

This program is my implementation of the game BreakOut (also known as BrickBreaker) leveraging the Pygame module in Python.

The objective of this game is simple: use the paddle to keep the ball from falling out the bottom of the screen and hit all bricks to clear the board. You only get two lives, so you better make them count!
