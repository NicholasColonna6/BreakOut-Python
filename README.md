# BreakOut - Python

#### This program is my implementation of the game BreakOut (also known as BrickBreaker) leveraging the Pygame module in Python.


The objective of this game is simple: use the paddle to hit the ball into all bricks without the ball falling below the paddle and out of the display. If the ball falls off the screen twice, it's game over!

### Instructions
1. Download and run 'breakout_game.py' from the command line
2. Use the left and right arrow keys to control the paddle
3. Move the paddle back and forth to keep the ball from falling below the paddle
4. Once you win or lose, you can restart the game by pressing 'Space' or quit by pressing 'Q'

### Future Enhancements
* Improve the mechanics of the ball to make the game more challenging
  * You should be able to deflect the ball in the opposite direction depending on where you hit the ball on the paddle
    * Ex: Hitting the left side of the paddle should send the ball to the left, and vice versa
  * You should be able to hit the ball and have the angle of trajectory change as well
* Allow the user to control when the ball starts moving at the start of the game
* Implement functionality to pause the game
* Create multiple levels with different arrangement of bricks and/or ball speed
